1. 'An integrated framework of automatic document summarization and classification', 정형일. 박사졸업논문 2014 
	read 06.27 - 07.06
	- Introduces related work of document summarization using traditional methods from 2000 - 2013. 
	- Defines Relevance Feedback Method, Binary Independence Model, Cluster-based Language Model, 
	  Pseudo Relevance Feedback Method. 
	- Above are only the part of the dissertation.
	
2. 'A Neural Attention Model for Sentence Summarization', Rush et al. EMNLP, 2015.
	read 06.27 - 07.03
	- Introduces method of abstractive sentence summarization using Neural Network.
	- It sets language model as a foundation of the subject to be trained. 
	- Based on the Language model from Bengio et al. 2013 (NNLM), it incorporates a encoder 
	  which conveys information of the input text and decoding context into the language model. 
	- Encoder has three options to be chosen.
		i) Bow
		ii) Convolutional
		iii) Attention
